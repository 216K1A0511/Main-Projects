# Test Submission Form

This project implements a React-based form that allows users to submit their test responses to the backend via the `POST /submit` API endpoint. It is designed for the IELTS Speaking Test platform to collect and process user responses effectively.

## Features

- **Form Design**: Collects test responses with fields for question ID, user response, and optional details like user ID or comments.
- **API Integration**: Submits form data to the backend and validates the API response to confirm successful submission.
- **State Management**: Utilizes React's `useState` hook to manage form inputs and submission status.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages for failed API calls or missing required fields and provides feedback for successful submissions.
- **Styling**: Ensures a user-friendly and responsive interface with clear labels and validation feedback.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/test-submission-form.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd test-submission-form
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the form.

## Project Structure

- `src/`
  - `components/`
    - `TestSubmissionForm.js`: The main form component for collecting and submitting test responses.
  - `App.js`: The root component that renders the `TestSubmissionForm`.
  - `index.js`: The entry point of the application.

## API Integration

The form submits data to the backend using the `POST /submit` API endpoint. Ensure that the backend server is running and accessible at the specified URL.

## Testing

To test the form functionality:

1. Fill in the required fields in the form.
2. Submit the form and observe the feedback messages for success or error indications.
3. Verify the submitted data in the backend to confirm successful integration.

## Evidence of Functionality

Please refer to the `evidence/` directory for screenshots and screen recordings demonstrating the form's functionality and successful API integration.

## Submission Guidelines

- Include the `TestSubmissionForm.js` file.
- Provide backend API details or a description of how the submission was tested.
- Attach evidence of form functionality, such as screen recordings or API responses.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Form Design and Functionality (40%)**: The form collects all necessary data and validates inputs.
2. **API Integration (30%)**: Form data is correctly submitted to the backend, and responses are handled appropriately.
3. **Error Handling and Feedback (20%)**: Proper feedback for both successful and failed submissions.
4. **Submission Completeness (10%)**: All required files and testing evidence are included.

## Key Considerations

- Align the form design with the overall UI theme of the platform.
- Validate input fields to ensure test takers provide all required data before submission.
- Use clean and modular code for better readability and scalability.
